# Face-recognition
This project was created as part of the final project for a course at the University of Calgary.



The aim of this research is to explore the application of machine learning in the field of people identity management for security purposes. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of two classifiers, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors, for face recognition using Local Binary Patterns (LBP) feature extraction technique. The database comprises 40 individuals, each having 10 images with different poses and facial expressions. Two-fold cross-validation is employed for evaluating the classifiers, and performance metrics such as accuracy, False Acceptance Rate, and False Rejection Rate are computed for each fold. The optimal parameters for SVM are determined using GridSearchCV. The findings suggest that the LBP-SVM technique achieves an accuracy of 95% and FAR of 0.12 in the best-case scenario. However, the study highlights that the accuracy can be further enhanced with larger and more diverse datasets.
